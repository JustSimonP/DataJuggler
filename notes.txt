1. Different os have different representation of new line in String


Plan:
1. Default list of choices for the user to find what he needs:
    a) find by value
    b) find by property name
    c) find by property name and value
    etc.

2. Filter builder UI-when user needs something more complicated
What should Filter Builder have?
-> list of permitted values
-> logical operations OR, AND, NOT for every case of properties
let formatted_json = serde_json::from_str::<Value>(contents.as_str());
use_shared_state_provider(cx,  || FullJsonTree {deserialized_json: formatted_json.expect("Deserialization has failed")});


3. Use rust rayon parallelism library for faster processing?


| Action in `app()`                    | Subscribes to re-renders?     |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `use_shared_state_provider(...)`     | ❌ No (just provides)          |
| `use_shared_state::<T>(cx).unwrap()` | ✅ Yes (subscribes to updates) |
| Accessing `.read()` or `.with()`     | ✅ Yes                         |
| Only `.write()` or `.write_silent()` | ❌ Doesn't subscribe           |
